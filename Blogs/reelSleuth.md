This is a personal project of mine and is a website where you can search for movies, add them to your wishlist, keep track of what you've watched, and mark your favorites.

## Project Overview

I've always been a movie buff and wanted to keep track of the movies I watched, hence I decided to go ahead and make a website to mark my favorites, watched and keep a track of the movies I want to watch.

Presenting to you, **[ReelSleuth](https://reelsleuth.netlify.app/)**

## Technologies
- I have used ```Javascript``` that does most of the heavy-lifting.
- With ```Javascript```, I fetch details of movies and cast from the ```TMDB``` api.
- On the user-authentication side of things, I used ```firebase-auth``` to login, sign-up and validate/authorize users.
- For storing the users `watchlist, watched and favorites`, I used `firebase`.

## Features
The user can:
- View newly released movies from up to 30 regions. (can be increased)
- View trending movies from `today` and of the `week`.
- View a specific movie's info, it's trailer and it's cast/crew.
- View more details about a particular cast or crew from a movie.
- Search for a specific movie.
- Add movies to the `watched`, `favorites`, `watchlist`
- Login/SignUp



And finally,
